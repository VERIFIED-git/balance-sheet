# Balance Sheet Project

This project aims to create a financial balance sheet with an added layer of CSS styling. By utilizing CSS pseudo selectors, you will have the ability to dynamically change the style of specific HTML elements based on user interactions.

## Features

- **CSS Pseudo Selectors**: The project leverages CSS pseudo selectors to enhance the styling of the balance sheet. By targeting specific elements or states, such as hovering over an element with the mouse, you can apply custom styles to create interactive effects and visual feedback.

- **Hover Effects**: When hovering over elements in the balance sheet, CSS pseudo selectors allow you to change their appearance dynamically. This feature enhances user experience by providing interactive and visually engaging effects.

- **Event Triggering**: Alongside hover effects, you will also learn how to trigger other events on your webpage using CSS pseudo selectors. This can include actions such as changing the style of elements on click or applying transformations on certain interactions.
